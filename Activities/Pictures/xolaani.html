                Xolaani, once a humble warrior, was forever changed by the dark powers that overtook her. Assimilating other Darkin like Anaakca, she transformed into her final form - Xolaani, Aspect's Bane. This new form embodies the culmination of all her rage, strength, and dark magic.
                Xolaani's transformation into Aspect's Bane has granted her unimaginable power, so much so that even the Aspects of Targon, gods who were thought to be invincible, cannot defeat her. As she stands, her form radiates an aura of pure destruction, with the power to annihilate entire realms at will. Her once human-like appearance has shifted into a terrifying god-like being, a true reflection of her wrathful nature.
