                Varus is a unique Darkin among his other darkin siblings, distinguished by his more human-like form, unlike most who have horrific shapes. This is due to his origin as a sadistic warrior in the war against the Void, after which he was sealed in his bow and hidden at the bottom of a well in Palas, Ionia.
